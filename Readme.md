# Signature Verification

## Project Description

Create message signature verification utilities on the Aptos blockchain using Move smart contracts. This project provides a decentralized system for cryptographically signing messages and verifying their authenticity on-chain. The system leverages Ed25519 digital signatures to ensure message integrity and authenticity in a trustless environment, allowing users to store and validate signed messages permanently on the blockchain.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to establish a foundational layer for digital trust on the Aptos blockchain by providing reliable, decentralized signature verification services. We aim to eliminate the need for centralized certificate authorities by creating a transparent, immutable, and globally accessible platform where digital signatures can be verified with mathematical certainty. This infrastructure will serve as a building block for secure communication, document authentication, and identity verification in the Web3 ecosystem.
